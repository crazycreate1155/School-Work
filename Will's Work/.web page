<p style="text-align: center; font-size: 24px;"><em><strong>Australia's Great Barrier Reef is the largest reef structure on the planet</strong></em></p>

<hr>

It stretches for over 1400 miles and is home to a very diverse selection of marine creatures such as fish, turtles, dolphins, sharks and even crocodiles! 
<p>The reef itself is a living animal and is made up of thousands of varieties of soft and hard corals. It grows at a rate of about 5mm per year.
<p>It is believed that rising sea levels and temperatures could harm the reef and its inhabitants.</p>
